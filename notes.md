# Yes, You Can Use Open Source

### Title

- get you excited about open source
- tell you about some folks who can help you get started

### License

- free to reuse slides

### Contact Info

- free to tweet about talk
- get in touch later
- will post again at the end of the talk

### Lots of Data

- researchers and analysts are dealing with lots of data
- need computers to do management and processing
- computers were invented for doing repetive tasks
- humans do human things, computers do computer things
- obstacle is that computers are picky about how you tell them to do things

### Synthicity

- I work at Synthicity, do consulting with municipal governments]
- we deal with lots of tabular and GIS data
- definitely need computers

### Open Source Tools

- at Synthicity we use open source Python tools for data science
- Python is awesome!
- Lots of people use R, too

### Open Source is Awesome

- FREE!
- no licenses
- global communities
- globally available, fewer restrictions for collaborators

### Open Source is Not Awesome

- indecipherable documentation
- installation is a huge headache
- cryptic, seemingly random errors
- real, actual trolls
- can seem designed to keep you out

### Digital Divide pt. 1

- we all start on the left side of this digital divide
- over on the right is the magical world where you've learned
    to read documentation and decypher errors
- you need a bridge!

### Digital Divide pt. 2

- possible to learn to read documentation and decypher errors,
    but there's little help to do that in traditional programs
- some people build this bridge out of blood, sweat, tears, and time
- other people have friends, mentors, or advisors that help them
- in a little bit I'll tell you about Software Carpentry, a group that
    wants to help you build your own bridge

### Tools

- once you've crossed the digital divide we hope you'll be able
    to make your own tools
- connect them up in novel ways to create your own pipelines
- automate common tasks
- tackle problems you couldn't when using off-the-shelf tools

### Master Builders

- which, of course, makes you a master builder

### Collaboration

- ultimately we want you to be:
    - happy
    - stress-free
    - collaborating like an open source developer
    - doing amazing science

### Software Carpentry

- Software Carpentry is here to help you on your way
- have to treat software like you would any piece of lab equipment
- save a day-a-week for the rest of your career

### What We Teach

- shell, git, programming, SQL
- automation, tracking/sharing, reuse work, think about your data

### We're Busy!

- lots of instructors, boot camps, and students

### Global

- we're doing boot camps wherever you are

### Volunteers

- lots of nice people
